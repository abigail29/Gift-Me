GIFT ME:
It is an application designed to help people not forget their friends and families birthdays, holidays, etc.

As the user you are able to create profiles for people.  After you add in their name, birthday, and description (things they like) you are done creating their profile.

Then you are able to add gifts to the persons profile. For the gifts you are able to add in the gift name, price, date/reason (is it for their birthday, mothers day, fathers day, Christmas, valentines day, Hanukkah, etc. and the category the gift goes in.

The categories were generated by using the Etsy API.  After you have selected a category and submitted the gift form, your gift name becomes a link that when pressed on brings you to the Etsy category website.

You are able to delete people once there are no more gift ideas for them and you are able to edit the gifts.  

Enjoy!
